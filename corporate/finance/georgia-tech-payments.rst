:og:description: Most program expenses should be charged directly to Georgia Tech. However, some expense categories, particularly lodging, must be reimbursed per Georgia Tech policy, or business requirements may dictate purchasing materials on a RoboJackets corporate card for expediency. At the discretion of the student officer team, if funds are available from a Georgia Tech account, a reimbursement request should be submitted to Georgia Tech.

Most program expenses should be charged directly to Georgia Tech.
However, some expense categories, `particularly lodging <https://policylibrary.gatech.edu/business-finance/lodging>`_, must be reimbursed per Georgia Tech policy, or business requirements may dictate purchasing materials on a RoboJackets corporate card for expediency.

At the discretion of the student officer team, if funds are available from a Georgia Tech account, a reimbursement request should be submitted to Georgia Tech.
All reimbursement payments are disbursed as paper checks mailed to the `external committee member <https://loop.robojackets.org/docs/workday/external-committee-members/>`_ address.

Both reimbursement requests and payments are tracked and reconciled within `Loop <https://loop.robojackets.org>`_.
Review the `Loop documentation <https://loop.robojackets.org/docs/>`_ for specific procedures.

Excess payments
---------------

Georgia Tech may occasionally pay out reimbursements that don't match an actual expense incurred by RoboJackets, either due to RoboJackets or Georgia Tech error.
Due to challenges in matching expenses to reimbursements and the time required to resolve issues, RoboJackets notifies Georgia Tech departments of excess payments and returns funds on an annual basis, in :ref:`April <corporate/calendar:April>`.

Payments should be returned per instructions from the receiving department.
Most payment types should be sent out from `Mercury <https://mercury.com>`_.
After posting, the transaction should be `recorded as a refund within QuickBooks Online <https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/customer-refunds-credits/record-customer-refund-quickbooks-online/L5PbCkJk8_US_en_US>`_.

.. note::
   Loop currently doesn't store account-level charges for `expense reports <https://loop.robojackets.org/docs/workday/expense-reports/>`_, so a Georgia Tech employee must provide that level of detail for any expense reports that should be refunded.

.. vale Google.Parens = NO

Excess payments from :abbr:`SGA (Student Government Association)` or custodial accounts should be returned to the `Student Organization Finance Office <https://sofo.gatech.edu>`_ for processing.

.. vale Google.Parens = YES

Excess payments from Georgia Tech Foundation accounts should be returned to the department that manages the account, regardless of the department that processed the payment.
