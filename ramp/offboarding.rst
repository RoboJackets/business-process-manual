===========

Ramp is integrated with RoboJackets' `user management infrastructure <https://github.com/RoboJackets/jedi>`_, and accounts are automatically deactivated after the dues deadline when a member doesn't pay dues.
Members can also be `manually deactivated by an administrator <https://support.ramp.com/hc/en-us/articles/5467490500499-Terminate-users-from-Ramp>`_ if needed.

.. important::
  **Members shouldn't be permanently removed from Ramp.**
  Deactivating a user is sufficient to prevent spending, and allows for re-activating their existing account in the future if necessary.
  `Review the Ramp help center documentation for more information about user states <https://support.ramp.com/hc/en-us/articles/39946511767443-Understanding-user-states-in-Ramp>`_.

Members **aren't** automatically re-activated -- an administrator must manually re-activate their account within Ramp once they pay dues.
