Sales tax returns must be submitted within Georgia Tax Center.
A return must be filed even if no sales tax was collected in that period.

#. Log in at https://gtc.dor.ga.gov/.
#. Under the :guilabel:`Sales and Use Tax` account, click :guilabel:`View Returns`.
#. Locate the period in the list, then click :guilabel:`File Return`.
#. Follow the instructions on screen to file the return.

Once the return is filed, if a payment is due, click :guilabel:`Make a Payment`, and follow the instructions on screen.

.. note::
   Georgia provides 3% vendor compensation, also known as vendor discount, for sales tax returns that are filed electronically and on time.
   This means the amount due to the state is typically less than what was collected by Square.
   The difference should be classified as income within QuickBooks.
