:og:description: While we prefer electronic payments, RoboJackets occasionally receives cash or paper checks. Dues and trip fee payments must be recorded in Apiary at the time the payment is accepted from the student. Apiary will send an email receipt to the student. Cash and checks should be kept in the safe when not in transit, and should be deposited as soon as practical.
